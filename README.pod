=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a Redis backend for the session engine of Dancer application. This module is a descendant
of L<Dancer::Session::Abstract>. A simple demo application might be found in the C<eg/> directory of this
distribution.

B<This version has been forked from the original version to provide an in memory hash for applications that distribute the
session via Redis but want to be able to do quick successive reads of values without a round trip to the Redis server.>

=head1 CONFIGURATION

In order to use this session engine, you have to set up a few settings (in the app or app's configuration file).

=head2 session

Set the value B<Redis>. Required parameter.

=head2 redis_session

Settings for backend.

=head3 server

Hostname and port of the redis-server instance which will be used to store session data. This one is B<required> unless I<sock> is defined.

=head3 sock

unix socket path of the redis-server instance which will be used to store session data.

=head3 password

Password string for redis-server's AUTH command to processing any other commands. Optional. Check the redis-server
manual for directive I<requirepass> if you would to use redis internal authentication.

=head3 database

Database # to store session data. Optional. Default value is 0.

=head3 expire

Session TTL. Optional. Default value is 900 (seconds).

=head3 debug

Enables debug information to STDERR, including all interactions with the redis-server. Optional. Default value is 0.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init

Validate settings and creates the initial connection to redis-server.

=head2 redis

Returns connection handle to the redis instance. Also establish new connection in case of C<dead> handle.

=head2 create

Creates a new object, runs C<flush> and returns the object.

=head2 flush

Writes the session information to the Redis database.

=head2 retrieve

Retrieves session information from the Redis database.

=head2 destroy
